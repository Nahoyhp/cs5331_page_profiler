Problem 1: DiffChecker comparison doesn't guarantee difference at word level.
	-> E.g. <p> Name: Hello </p> Vs <p> Name: <script> Hello World </script> </p>. The algorithm will highligh the whole <p> tag as the difference.
	-> Solution 1: Trying to format the html.
		-> By converting <tag> -> <tag>/n and </tag> -> \n<tag>
		-> A lot harder because of inconsistent format
			- E.g. tag can include letters and digits
			- there can be words or even symbols before and after <tag> -> E.g. <p>Welcome!</p>
			- Using regex, we need to sure that <p>Welcome!</p> becomes <p>\nWelcome!\n</p>
	-> Computational Expensive

- Can try to use Guesslang to resolve Problem 2 and 3.
	- However, the Confidence level is very low due to short string.
	- Similarity between difference languages.
	- Javascript mixing with 


Problem 2: Running JS code on the environment
	-> Typically run in the browser or server respectively.
		- Without <script> we can use js2py module to run it.
	-> The snippet that we want to test on might includeHTML, Javascript or a combiniation of the two.
		- E.g. <script>alert("XSS")</script>
		- running ^ in JS will throw error.
		

Problem 3: Running PHP code in the environment
	->  Typically run in the server respectively.
		-> doesn't seem to have a module for it.
		-> The "only" way I found is to use subprocess. Eval() seems to have possibility of XSS as well.
			-> Do we need to care if we are doing in docker/other environment?
			-> Rn, i think no need to care. 
	-> Enclosed in <? ... ?> Therefore, we can just take whatever is in between.

[X] Problem 4: What if the inject cross multiple line.
	-> Solved. By combining thoses inserted lines on different lines into one.

Problem 5: How to distinguish between two types of error.
	-> Lacks of local information. E.g. in php script, using local variables.
	-> We need a way to distinguish between 
		1) Error due to invalid synatx (i.e. not php scripts)
		2) 


Problem X: Injected XSS is still ran on the server machine.
	-> It's something that we want to avoid in the first replace.
	-> Solution: Use of docker container and execute in the inject. Destroy docker afterwards.
		-> For the host to know docker's status i.e. if the execution is successful or not, host still need access to the docker. this connection could be a place for vulnerability.
